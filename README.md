# ML-beginners_Projs

Welcome to ** ML-beginners_Projs** ‚Äì a collection of beginner-friendly machine learning projects. This repository is designed to help reinforce core ML concepts using popular datasets and classic problems.

Each project includes:
- A standalone folder
- A Script containing py codes
- Its own README file explaining the approach, data, and results

---

## üîç Projects

### 1. [Titanic Survival Prediction](./Titanic/)
Predict survival on the Titanic using the classic Kaggle dataset. A binary classification problem that introduces data preprocessing, feature engineering, and logistic regression.

### 2. [Iris Classification](./Iris%20classificatio/)
A multiclass classification task using the Iris dataset. Learn how to train and evaluate simple classifiers like KNN and Decision Trees.

### 3. [Wine Quality Prediction](./wine%20qualty/) *(Coming Soon)*
Predict wine quality (score between 0‚Äì10) based on chemical properties. This project explores regression models using the `sklearn.datasets.load_wine()` dataset.
